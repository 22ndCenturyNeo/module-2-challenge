        <p id="in-korea-writing">I was born in a hospital in Bucheon, South Korea, in 1982. As a baby, I lived in Seoul, and from elementary school onwards, I grew up in Gyeonggi Province. I served in the military and lived in Korea until I was 28. When I was in elementary school, I thought the world was perfect. During my teenage years, I realized how wrong I was. My mother loved me more than any other mother could, but she wasn't the warmest. In the military, I met amazing comrades and regained my confidence, leaving with a positive view of my service.</p>
